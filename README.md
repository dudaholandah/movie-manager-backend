# Movie Manager Backend

This project is a backend implementation for a movie manager, built using **Java Spring Boot** to create a robust framework and **PostgreSQL** as database, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval of movie-related data. 

It incorporates key features including **CRUD** operations for managing movies, the implementation of **Data Transfer Objects (DTO)** to enhance data exchange, and a 
**caching mechanism** to improve performance.
